# ResearchGPT
ResearchGPT takes in any query about a field you may have, such as "What are some papers that can help me understand how I can use reinforcement learning for music?" It then outputs relevant research papers using LlamaIndex and ChatGPT to tailor the papers exactly as per the query request. This would speed up a lot of unnecessary browsing that may pain students and researchers and also quickly finds what would be most helpful. A big problem is that some niche research papers that are brand new may not be found easily, so this program solves that efficiently and effectively for ease of use. Currently, we are working on a predownloaded database of roughly 1000 papers from arxiv.org as to speed up the process of indexing, but this can be easily edited in the code. Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability.
